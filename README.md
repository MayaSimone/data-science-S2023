# data-science-curriculum

This Maya Sivanandan's copy of a curriculum of **open-source** data science exercises, intended to take a student from zero coding experience to basic data science literacy. These exercises are heavily inspired by the (discontinued) [Data Challenge Lab](https://dcl-docs.stanford.edu/home/) at Stanford University and rely on the [Tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/).

- [Curriculum](https://github.com/zdelrosario/data-science-curriculum/blob/master/curriculum.md) contains the desired learning outcomes of this material
- [Exercises](https://github.com/zdelrosario/data-science-curriculum/tree/master/exercises) contains the exercises, which provide a first introduction to using the Tidyverse to do Data Science
- [Challenges](https://github.com/zdelrosario/data-science-curriculum/tree/master/challenges) contains more open-ended data challenges, which will test and build upon your skills from the exercises
- [Content visualization script](https://github.com/zdelrosario/data-science-curriculum/blob/master/scripts/vis-metadata.Rmd) to help sequence course content and visualize topics
- [Sequencing script](https://github.com/zdelrosario/data-science-curriculum/blob/master/scripts/make-schedule.Rmd) to help assign exercise and challenge due dates

## Course Description

Data Science is a powerful toolkit to extract usable insights from data. In this class, you will learn tools and gain understanding. You will use software tools to *liberate* data from published images and tables, wrangle messy datasets into machine learning (ML)-ready form, fit and interpret ML models, and visualize to extract meaning. You will also speak the language of uncertainty---statistics---to avoid getting fooled by models. You will criticize published findings and ask what is, and what is not, in the data. Assignments will include regular practice exercises, progressively puzzling real-data challenges, and a final project of your choice where you obtain, wrangle, and understand a dataset.
