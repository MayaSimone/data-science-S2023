*Purpose*: Most real problems have multiple sources of uncertainty mixed together. Untangling these different sources can be challenging, even on a conceptual level. In this challenge we'll study a simple problem of structural safety, and use this small case study to untangle sources of sampling and Monte Carlo uncertainty.

*Note*: In this challenge, I provide a lot of stub-code; you won't have to do too much coding. This is because I want you to *focus on answering the conceptual questions*. The most important questions in this challenge are: *What sources of uncertainty are you accounting for? What sources are you not accounting for? Are those sources real or induced?*

# Setup
<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

```{r setup}
library(MASS)
library(rsample)
library(broom)
library(tidyverse)
filename_samples <- "./data/al_samples.csv"

```

*Background*: The [strength](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_tensile_strength) of a material is the amount of mechanical stress it can survive before breaking. To illustrate: Stresses are internal forces that hold an object together when we try to squeeze, stretch, or otherwise deform a solid object. For instance, if we pull on a rectangular bar of material, internal stresses $\sigma$ work to keep the bar together.

*Strength* is a measure of how much internal stress an object can survive: A higher strength means a stronger material. This challenge's data are very simple: They are (synthetic) observations of ultimate tensile strength (UTS) on individual samples of the same aluminum alloy. The experiments were carried out following the highest standards of experimental rigor, so you should consider these values to be the "true" breaking strength for each sample.

```{r read-data}
## NOTE: No need to edit; load data
df_samples <- read_csv(filename_samples)
df_samples
```
Data Dictionary:

| Quantity       | Units |
|----------------|-------|
| Strength (UTS) | psi   |

### __q1__ Visualize the strength data with a histogram. Answer the questions below.

```{r q1-task}
df_samples %>%
  ggplot(aes(strength)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 100, boundary = 0.005)

```

**Observations**:

- What is the mean strength of the material, approximately?
  - About 39900 psi
- To what extent can you tell what shape the distribution of the data has?
  - There are not very many data points, so the distribution of the data looks very different based on the bin size of the histogram. With a `binwidth` of 100 or 120, the distribution looks somewhat similar to a normal distribution.
- Assuming the scopus is the strength of an individual part made from this aluminum alloy, is the observed variability real or induced?
  - The variability would be real since the measurements because the measurements were taken in accordance with the "highest standards of experimental rigor"

# Assessing Structural Safety
<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

*Objective*: In this challenge you are going to study a structure and assess its *probability of failure* (POF). A higher POF corresponds to a more unsafe structure. Ultimately, we want

$$\text{POF} < 0.03.$$

Your job is to assess a given structure using the data provided and determine whether you can *confidently* conclude that `POF < 0.03`.

## Structural model
<!-- --------------------------------------- -->

The following code chunk sets up a structural model: We are considering a rectangular bar under uniaxial tensile load (as pictured above). A larger cross-sectional area `A` is capable of surviving a greater load `L`, but a larger `A` is a heavier (more expensive) structure. The internal stress is approximately `sigma = L / A`---we simply compare this quantity against the strength.

I pick particular values for `A, L` and package all the information in the *limit state function* `g_break`:

```{r model-setup}
## NOTE: No need to edit; model setup
A <- 0.0255 # Cross-sectional area
L <- 1000 # Applied load (lbs)

g_break <- function(strength) {
  strength - L / A
}
```

The *probability of failure* (POF) is then defined in terms of the limit state $g$ via:

$$\text{POF} \equiv \mathbb{P}[g \leq 0].$$

### __q2__ Using the observations in `df_samples` and the structural model `g_break()`, estimate the probability of failure.

*Hint*: In `c07-monte-carlo` you learned how to estimate a probability as the `mean()` of an indicator. Use the same strategy here.

```{r q2-task}
## TODO: Estimate the probability of failure; i.e. POF = Pr[g <= 0]
stats <- 
  df_samples %>% 
  g_break()

POF <- 
  mean(stats <= 0)
POF
```

**Observations**:

- Does this estimate satisfy `POF < 0.03`?
  - Yes since POF = 0
- Is this estimate of the probability of failure trustworthy? Why or why not?
  - I don't think I trust this estimate of the probability of failure since assuming `POF = 0` is trustworthy means that we believe this part will never break, which a big assumption to be made from only 25 data points.
- Can you confidently conclude that `POF < 0.03`? Why or why not.
  - I would not confidently conclude that POF < 0.03 since I don't find the estimated POF to be trustworthy given that it was calculated from so few data points (25)

## Material property model
<!-- --------------------------------------- -->

Since we have so few physical samples, we will fit a distribution to model the material property. This will give us the means to draw "virtual samples" and use those to estimate the POF.

### __q3__ Fit a lognormal distribution to the strength data using the `fitdistr()` function.

*Note*: In this challenge I generated the `strength` data from a `lognormal` distribution; if you didn't know that fact, then the choice of distribution would be an *additional* source of uncertainty!

*Hint 1*: We learned how to do this in `e-stat08-fit-dist`.

*Hint 2*: The `fitdistr` function uses `densfun = "lognormal"` to specify a lognormal distribution.

```{r q3-task}
## TODO:
df_fit <- 
  fitdistr(df_samples$strength, densfun = "lognormal")

df_fit
```

Once you've successfully fit a model for the strength, you can estimate the probability of failure by drawing samples from the fitted distribution.

### __q4__ Complete the code below by 1. choosing a Monte Carlo sample size `n_monte_carlo`, 2. extracting the estimated parameters from q3, and 3. computing the limit state value `g = g_break()`. Answer the questions under *observations* below.

*Hint 1*: You will need to combine ideas from `c07-monte-carlo` and `e-stat08-fit-dist` in order to complete this task.

*Hint 2*: The function `rlnorm()` will allow you to draw samples from a lognormal distribution.

```{r q4-task}
## TODO 1: Choose Monte Carlo sample size
n_monte_carlo <- 10000

## TODO 2: Extract parameter estimates from df_fit
strength_meanlog <- df_fit$estimate[1]
strength_sdlog <- df_fit$estimate[2]

set.seed(739)
# Generate samples
df_norm_sim <-
  tibble(strength = rlnorm(n_monte_carlo, strength_meanlog, strength_sdlog)) %>%
## TODO 3: Compute structural response
  glimpse()

## NOTE: The following code estimates the POF and a 95% confidence interval
df_norm_pof <-
  df_norm_sim %>%
  mutate(stat = g_break(strength) <= 0) %>%
  summarize(
    pof_est = mean(stat),
    se = sd(stat) / sqrt(n_monte_carlo)
  ) %>%
  mutate(
    pof_lo = pof_est - 1.96 * se,
    pof_hi = pof_est + 1.96 * se
  ) %>%
  select(pof_lo, pof_est, pof_hi)

df_norm_pof
```

- Assuming your scopus is the probability of failure `POF` defined above, does your estimate exhibit real variability, induced variability, or both?
  - Induced variability which comes from the small sample size
- Does this confidence interval imply that `POF < 0.03`?
  - Yes because even the highest estimate of POF is less than 0.03 (0.022)
- Compare this probability with your estimate from q2; is it more or less trustworthy?
  - I would say this result is more trustworthy because it based off of 400X more data points, and these data points are generated to follow similar trends of the "real" data collected from experiments (having the same mean and standard deviation).
- Does the confidence interval above account for uncertainty arising from the *Monte Carlo approximation*? Why or why not?
  - Yes because we use standard error across all Monte Carlo samples
- Does the confidence interval above account for uncertainty arising from *limited physical tests* (`df_samples`)? Why or why not?
  - I think it does to some degree since it is now using many more data points than were used in `q2`; however, the approximation is still based off of only 25 measurements. 
- What could you do to tighten up the confidence interval?
  - Potentially generate more values with the Monte Carlo approximation or collect more physical measurements
- Can you *confidently* conclude that `POF < 0.03`? Why or why not?
  - No because there's hasn't been anything done to try and calculate the uncertainty from the Monte Carlo approximation. If I knew a little more about the approximation compares to the experimentally measured data, I could be more confident.

## A different way to compute the POF
<!-- --------------------------------------- -->

Monte Carlo is a *general* way to estimate probabilities, but it introduces approximation error. It turns out that, for the simple problem we're studying, we can compute the probability directly using the CDF. Note that for our structural safety problem, we have

$$\text{POF} = \mathbb{P}[g \leq 0] = \mathbb{P}[S \leq L / A] = \text{CDF}_S(L/A).$$

Since `S = rlnorm(n, meanlog = strength_meanlog, sdlog = strength_sdlog)`, we can use `plnorm` to compute the probability of failure without Monte Carlo as `POF = plnorm(L/A, meanlog = strength_meanlog, sdlog = strength_sdlog)`. Let's combine this idea with the fitted distribution to estimate the POF.

### __q5__ Finish the following function by computing the POF with `plnorm()`. Answer the questions under *observations* below.

```{r q5-task}
## TODO: Complete the function below;
##       note that you only need to edit the TODO section

estimate_pof <- function(df) {
  ## Fit the distribution
  df_fit <-
    df %>%
    pull(strength) %>%
    fitdistr(densfun = "lognormal") %>%
    tidy()

  ## Extract the parameters
  strength_meanlog <-
    df_fit %>%
    filter(term == "meanlog") %>%
    pull(estimate)
  strength_sdlog <-
    df_fit %>%
    filter(term == "sdlog") %>%
    pull(estimate)

## TODO: Estimate the probability of failure using plnorm
  pof_estimate <- plnorm(L/A, meanlog = strength_meanlog, sdlog = strength_sdlog)

  ## NOTE: No need to edit; this last line returns your pof_estimate
  pof_estimate
}

## NOTE: No need to edit; test your function
df_samples %>% estimate_pof()
```

**Observations**:

- How does this estimate compare with your Monte Carlo estimate above?
  - It is slightly lower (about 0.001)
- Does this estimate have any uncertainty due to *Monte Carlo approximation*? Why or why not?
  - No because there is no Monte Carlo approximation and the function fit is based directly on the 25 measured data points
- With the scopus as the `POF`, would uncertainty due to *Monte Carlo approximation* be induced or real?
  - It would be induced because it comes from the process we do to collect the data samples.
- Does this estimate have any uncertainty due to *limited physical tests*? Why or why not?
  - Yes because the function model is only based off the 25 measurements from the physical tests
- With the scopus as the `POF`, would uncertainty due to *limited physical tests* be induced or real?
  - The physical tests are susceptible to both real and induced uncertainty (uncertainty from the manufacturing process and uncertainty from taking the measurements, respectively), but the uncertainty from limited physical tests is more specifically related to the induced uncertainty.

## Quantifying sampling uncertainty
<!-- --------------------------------------- -->

Using `plnorm()` gets rid of Monte Carlo error, but we still have uncertainty due to limited physical testing. Often we can use a CLT approximation to construct a confidence interval. However, with `plnorm()` we can't use a CLT approximation because it does not follow the assumptions of the central limit theorem (it's not a sum of iid random variables). Instead, we can use the *bootstrap* to approximate a confidence interval via resampling.

### __q6__ The code below estimates a bootstrap CI on your POF estimate. Answer the questions under *observations* below.

```{r q6-task}
## NOTE: No need to edit; run and inspect
tidycustom <- function(est) {tibble(term = "pof", estimate = est)}

df_samples %>%
  bootstraps(times = 1000) %>%
  mutate(
    estimates = map(
      splits,
      ~ analysis(.x) %>% estimate_pof() %>% tidycustom()
    )
  ) %>%
  int_pctl(estimates)
```

**Observations**:

- Does the confidence interval above account for uncertainty arising from *Monte Carlo approximation* of the POF? Why or why not?
  - No because estimating POF with `pl_norm()` removed the Monte Carlo error
- Does the confidence interval above account for uncertainty arising from *limited physical tests* (`df_samples`)? Why or why not?
  - Yes because we conducted bootstrap analysis
- Can you confidently conclude that `POF < 0.03`? Why or why not?
  - No because the upper confidence interval is ~0.04915, so the true POF is not guaranteed to be less than 0.03
