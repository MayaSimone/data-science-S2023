*Purpose*: When designing structures such as bridges, boats, and planes,
the design team needs data about *material properties*. Often when we
engineers first learn about material properties through coursework, we
talk about abstract ideas and look up values in tables without ever
looking at the data that gave rise to published properties. In this
challenge you’ll study an aluminum alloy dataset: Studying these data
will give you a better sense of the challenges underlying published
material values.

In this challenge, you will load a real dataset, wrangle it into tidy
form, and perform EDA to learn more about the data.

# Grading Rubric

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

Unlike exercises, **challenges will be graded**. The following rubrics
define how you will be graded, both on an individual and team basis.

*Background*: In 1946, scientists at the Bureau of Standards tested a
number of Aluminum plates to determine their
[elasticity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elastic_modulus) and
[Poisson’s ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson%27s_ratio).
These are key quantities used in the design of structural members, such
as aircraft skin under [buckling
loads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckling). These scientists tested
plats of various thicknesses, and at different angles with respect to
the [rolling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_(metalworking))
direction.

# Loading and Wrangle

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

The `readr` package in the Tidyverse contains functions to load data
form many sources. The `read_csv()` function will help us load the data
for this challenge.

``` r
## NOTE: If you extracted all challenges to the same location,
## you shouldn't have to change this filename
filename <- "./data/stang.csv"

## Load the data
df_stang <- read_csv(filename)
```

    ## Rows: 9 Columns: 8
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## chr (1): alloy
    ## dbl (7): thick, E_00, nu_00, E_45, nu_45, E_90, nu_90
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

``` r
df_stang
```

Note that these data are not tidy! The data in this form are convenient
for reporting in a table, but are not ideal for analysis.

### **q1** Tidy `df_stang` to produce `df_stang_long`. You should have column names `thick, alloy, angle, E, mu`. Make sure the `angle` variable is of correct type. Filter out any invalid values.

*Hint*: You can reshape in one `pivot` using the `".value"` special
value for `names_to`.

``` r
## TASK: Tidy `df_stang`
df_stang_long <-
  df_stang %>%
    pivot_longer(
      names_to = c(".value", "angle"),
      names_sep = "_",
      values_to = "val",
      cols = c(-thick, -alloy)
  ) %>%
  mutate(angle = as.integer(angle))

df_stang_long <- df_stang_long[df_stang_long$E >= 0, ]


df_stang_long
```

    ## 3 0.064     6
    ## 4 0.081     8

**Observations**:

- Is there “one true value” for the material properties of Aluminum?
  - No, in the data there seems to be some variation in the measurements
    of `E` and `nu` across the different samples. `E` varies from 10700
    to 9900 and `nu` varies from 0.03100 to 0.3310
  - Furthermore, even though elasticity and Poisson’s Ratio are
    considered material properties (constant for a particular alloy),
    this isn’t necessarily true to real life. The ‘known’ values are
    more a value that is representative of the dsitribution of possible
    values (based on the many aspects that can cause variation in these
    values from how the atoms are arranged to noise in a signal when
    collecting data digitally).
- How many aluminum alloys are in this dataset? How do you know?
  - One, the only alloy listed is `al_24st`
- What angles were tested?
  - 0, 45, 90 degrees
- What thicknesses were tested?
  - 0.022, 0.032, 0.064, 0.081 inches
- How does Poisson’s ratio vary with respect to thickness?
  - It’s hard to make any definitive conclusions from the basic EDA.

## Visualize

<!-- ------------------------- -->

### **q3** Create a visualization to investigate your question from q2 above. Can you find an answer to your question using the dataset? Would you need additional information to answer your question?

``` r
# mid<-mean(df_q2$Temp)

df_stang_long %>%
  ggplot() +
    geom_count(mapping = aes(x = thick, y = nu,
                             color = after_stat(n), size = 1)) +
  
    guides(color = 'legend') +
  
    guides(size = FALSE) +
  
    labs(x = "Thickness (in)", y = TeX("Poisson's Ratio"), 
         title = "Poisson's Ratio vs Thickness")
```

    ## Warning: The `<scale>` argument of `guides()` cannot be `FALSE`. Use "none" instead as
    ## of ggplot2 3.3.4.

![](c03-stang-assignment_files/figure-gfm/q3-task-1.png)<!-- -->

**Observations**:

- Poisson’s ratio does not seem to vary with thickness. For the three
  smallest thicknesses, the majority of the measurements are between
  0.317 and 0.330

- The plot does show that the measurements of the 0.081in samples showed
  slightly lower Poisson ratios, so there may be some sort of
  relationship between Poisson’s Ratio and thickness (perhaps something
  similar to a negative quadratic where the trend seems initially linear
  before decreasing). However, we only have the 0.081in measurements
  showing this downward trend, so this plot can not conclusively support
  the claim that Poisson’s Ratio decreases with increased thickness of a
  material.

### **q4** Consider the following statement:

“A material’s property (or material property) is an intensive property
of some material, i.e. a physical property that does not depend on the
amount of the material.”\[2\]

Note that the “amount of material” would vary with the thickness of a
tested plate. Does the following graph support or contradict the claim
that “elasticity `E` is an intensive material property.” Why or why not?
Is this evidence *conclusive* one way or another? Why or why not?

``` r
## NOTE: No need to change; run this chunk
df_stang_long %>%

  ggplot(aes(nu, E, color = as_factor(thick))) +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  theme_minimal()
```

![](c03-stang-assignment_files/figure-gfm/q4-vis-1.png)<!-- -->

**Observations**:

- Does this graph support or contradict the claim above?
  - When first looking at the graph, it does seem to contradict the
    claim above, since the measurements of the thickest alloy samples
    (0.081in) are distinctly different from the others, existing in a
    separate cluster of data points with lower elasticity and Poisson’s
    ratio. However, when reading the paper on how the measurements were
    collected, we find that the 0.081in samples were measured on a
    different apparatus than the other, thinner samples. This could be a
    source of systematic error, but more tests where all measurements
    are collected with the same piece of equipment (or all samples are
    measured on both apparatuses and compared) would be needed to
    determine if this is true. With the current data, this graph is not
    conclusive evidence disproving the claim.
